[[Start the adventure!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Start the adventure!" tags="" position="328,169" size="100,100">Bear was out walking one day in the forest. Her stomach began to growl.

Bear: &quot;Oh man! I sure am hungry and winter is coming!&quot;

Bear: &quot;I have no one to help me to survive the winter yet. I think the salmon are still in the river. Maybe they will help?&quot;

And with that thought, Bear thought if she should go to the river to talk with the salmon...

[[Travel to the river]]

[[Decide to go play instead]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Travel to the river" tags="" position="679,179" size="100,100">As she approached the river, Bear could hear the sounds of the river and of a shoal of salmon talking...

Head Salmon: &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do. The beaver won&#39;t let us through unless we tell them how many of us there are.&quot;

Big Salmon: &quot;Well we are many...&quot;

Head Salmon: &quot;Well I told them that we were many...&quot;

Head Salmon pauses for a second...

Head Salmon: &quot;But... they said that they don&#39;t understand many, only numbers.&quot;

Big Salmon: &quot;Sigh... Beavers...&quot;

[[Approach the Salmon]]

[[Keep listening]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Decide to go play instead" tags="" position="484,32" size="100,100">Bear: &quot;That was fun!&quot;

As Bear was sitting after a long time playing with her stomach growling, she remembered...

Bear: &quot;Oh shoot! I still need help to survive the winter!&quot;

Bear: &quot;I need to go to the river.&quot;

[[Travel to the river]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Approach the Salmon" tags="" position="936,222" size="100,100">Bear approaches the salmon and begins to conversate.

Bear: &quot;Hello! My name is Bear. I couldn&#39;t help but overhear of your problem. I too have a problem.&quot;

Bear ponders...

Bear: &quot;Maybe we can help each other?&quot;

Head Salmon and Big Salmon whisper amongst themselves...

Head Salmon: &quot;Bear is your name you say? Well Bear, I think that we might be able to possibly help each other...&quot;

[[Explain the situation to Head Salmon.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Keep listening" tags="" position="886,50" size="100,100">Big Salmon: &quot;Well, I think that we may need help to find out what the beavers want to know.&quot;

Head Salmon turns his head towards Bear and notices her just standing there on the bank of the river...

Head Salmon: &quot;Hmmm... Why is that bear just standing there?&quot;

Big Salmon: &quot;Hey you!&quot;

Big Salmon and Head Salmon both wave at Bear suggesting to come over and talk.

[[Approach the Salmon]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Explain the situation to Head Salmon." tags="" position="1174,213" size="100,100">Head Salmon: &quot;I see... So, you need help to survive the winter.&quot;

Bear: &quot;That is correct.&quot;

Big Salmon: &quot;A few of us could help you survive the winter, but we need to get past the beavers first.&quot;

Bear thinks about it for a second...

Bear: &quot;I can help you get past the beavers! I just need more information!&quot;

Head Salmon: &quot;We will tell you all we know.&quot;

[[Hear Head Salmon explain his problem.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Hear Head Salmon explain his problem." tags="" position="1398,211" size="100,100">Head Salmon: &quot;So, the beaver want to know the exact number that there are of us.&quot;

Big Salmon: &quot;But... as salmon, we know only up to 10. After that it is many.&quot;

Bear is listening carefully...

Head Salmon: &quot;We cannot know how many we are to the beavers because it is more than 10.&quot;

Big Salmon: &quot;Though... we do know some other things that might help you find the number that the beavers are looking for.&quot;

Bear waits for the extra information...

[[Continue talking]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="The Salmon Problem" tags="" position="1100,601" size="100,100">Bear: &quot;I&#39;ll tell you the number!&quot;

Bear remembers what Head Salmon said...

(In my shoal, we know that there are 1 more felmale for every 10 males. We also know that there are 8 more females than males. I ask you, how many are in my shoal?)

Bear says what she is thinking...

Bear: &quot;I think I got it. Let&#39;s go to the beavers!&quot;

Bear, Head Salmon, and the shoal all travel to the beavers&#39; dam...

Chief Beaver: &quot;Ah! Ah! Ah! The salmon have returned with a friend. My name is Chief Beaver and this is our dam. What is your name?&quot; 

Bear tells Chief Beaver her name.

Chief Beaver: &quot;Nice to meet you Bear. As you probably know, We beavers cannot count but we know numbers. We need to know the number of salmon, so we can let them pass...&quot;

While Chief Beaver is talking, Bear notices a coyote rolling in the dirt on the bank...

Chief Beaver: &quot;Ah! I see that you see Coyote. Coyote knows how many salmon there are, but he won&#39;t tell us. Although... He has agreed to tell us if you are telling the truth.&quot;

Chief Beaver: &quot;Wait Bear!&quot;

Chief Beaver waddles towards Bear and the salmon.

Chief Beaver: &quot;Over there is where Porcupine lives. There are some tasty Aspen trees in that grove. Porcupine doesn&#39;t like them as much as we do, and has offered us to harvest some of them.&quot;

Chief Beaver has a look of worry on his face...
